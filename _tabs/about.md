Iâ€™m a Brazilian software developer with more than 4 years of experience. My experience is mainly in high-performance applications in the security and financial area.

In the last few years, I have been working with Java (Spring Boot) and I have experience with relational databases (Postgres, Mysql and SQL Server) and NoSQL (MongoDb).

I've been developing applications with microservice architecture with the Spring Cloud stack and private clouds like AWS. 
I have work experience with SCRUM in multidisciplinary teams and CI/CD with Git, Gitlab, Docker and Jenkins and I have knowledge in unitary and integration tests, using frameworks such as JUnit, Mockito and TDD.

Also, in my spare time I like to read a good book, drink chimarrao, make churrasco, watch or play football soccer,ride my bicycle and go to the beach with my dog and people I like.
